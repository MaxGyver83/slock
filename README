slock - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X.

This is my personal fork with these changes (on the 'custom' branch):

- Apply 'slock-foreground-and-background' patch (blurred background with colored dwm logo)
- Change default color from black to gray
- Red dwm logo only after wrong password (not after Escape)
- Orange dwm logo when CapsLock is pressed (based on 'capscolor' patch)
- Orange dwm logo also after Escape (when CapsLock is pressed)
- Alternate color during password input: shades of blue (or orange)
- Makefile: Use group 'nobody' instead of 'nogroup' when available (Arch Linux)

Additional change on branch 'custom-set-password':

- Use custom password instead of login password. Build with 'make PW=xyz'.


Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
